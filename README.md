# SMS_Classifier

### 🚀 Introducing the SMS/Email Classifier Model 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project – a powerful SMS/Email classifier that boasts an impressive 97% accuracy! 📊

### Project Highlights:
✨ Random Forest Magic: Leveraging the robust Random Forest algorithm, this model has been trained to discern between SMS and email messages. The ensemble of decision trees enables accurate predictions, making it a reliable tool for message classification.

🧠 Smart Learning with NLTK: Harnessing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), the model is equipped with advanced NLP techniques, allowing it to understand and analyze the nuances of human language. NLTK's rich set of tools facilitates robust pre-processing and feature extraction.

🎯 High Accuracy, High Confidence: The classifier achieved a staggering 97% accuracy during testing, demonstrating its efficacy in distinguishing between SMS and email messages. This high accuracy ensures reliable performance in real-world scenarios.

I'm thrilled to share that this SMS/Email Classifier is now available for interactive use through a Streamlit web app! 🌐
